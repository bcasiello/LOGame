# MyLightsOut

Another example from [Pharo By Example](http://books.pharo.org/pharo-by-example/)

This is a Smalltalk implementation of the [Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) game/puzzle.

This version doesn't toggle the selected square, just its neighbors, which differs from the original game as described on Wikipedia. It also doesn't detect the 'win' conditition (all squares toggled), it's basically a demo of the Morphic UI.
